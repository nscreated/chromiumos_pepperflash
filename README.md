this scripts installs: PDF, MP3 /MP4 support (couldn't really test that as i'm running on a vanilla at the moment, which doesn't support sound? :( ) and flash!

all credits go to dz0ny, his script can be found here: https://gist.github.com/3065781 , but this script didn't work for me and more people. so i tried to do what his script did, but a little different.

this also downloads less files, but will have to be updated manually by me, or someone else if you edit the line after: echo "Downloading important data" to your own download link.

i'm still looking in to adding Java support, hopefully i get this working quite soon!

run this in your terminal:
